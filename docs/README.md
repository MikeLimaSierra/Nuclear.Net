# Nuclear.Net

`Nuclear.Net` is a collection of libraries with all sorts of more or less useful things.
It started out as one big library where i've put everything reusable i ever wrote.
Over the years it got a little messy so i decided to seperate parts out of it.

A few parts will most likely never see the day of light again because they are outdated by todays standards or because they are dog ugly and i feel too ashamed to show them around.
Other things may require an overhaul so that splitting this up into smaller packages is an ongoing task that will probably take a while for me to finish.

The compiled libraries are available for download through [my NuGet profile](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/MikeLimaSierra).
